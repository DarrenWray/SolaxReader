# SolaxReader
This C# library wraps the Solax, SolaxCloud, SolaxPower API, allowing the most recent statistics and information about your inverter to be collected and processed programmatically.

In order to access the SolaxCloud API, you must sign in to [https://www.solaxcloud.com/#/api](https://www.solaxcloud.com/#/api) and request a TokenId, this is in my experience a 23 digit numeric - This value must be entered into the value of strTokenId in your version of SolaxRealTime.cs


Please note that I am not affiliated with Solax Power, or Solax Cloud in anyway and have simple used [version 6.1 of the Solax API Documentation](https://www.solaxcloud.com/user_api/SolaxCloud_User_Monitoring_API_V6.1.pdf)
